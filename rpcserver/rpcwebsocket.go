// are interested in.  When an event happens elsewhere in the code such as
// transactions being added to the memory pool or block connects/disconnects,
// the notification manager is provided with the relevant details needed to
// figure out which websocket clients need to be notified based on what they
// have registered for and notifies them accordingly.  It is also used to keep
// track of all connected websocket clients.
